Case 1
Project staffing is a resource intensive process at XYZ. It starts with the submission of a
project request and ends either with winning or losing the project.
It is not a simple linear process and involves numerous steps and communication interfaces
between the sales team, clients and consultants.
Currently some of them happens outside the facilitation of the product, via emails, phone
conversations etc.
While our clients and consultants appreciate this highly personalized nature of the service it
doesn’t scale well. We believe that there are a lot of opportunities for the product to assist this
process by undertaking the non-value add activities, an improved process design and UX etc.,
while still preserving the personal touch.
In fact this is one of our main short term strategic goals for our product. However, we have yet to
identify the appropriate KPI(s) that will help the team to work towards this common goal. We
expect our product data analyst to drive this initiative. Please describe how you would work on
identifying the top level KPI(s) for this critical strategic goal of the Product & Engineering team.

Case 2
In the first step of the project staffing process, the sales representative and the client
collaboratively build a detailed online project briefing which includes among other information,
the project description including industry and functional topic, working conditions, the required
skills for the business expert etc. All this data helps our AI driven automated matching algorithm
to identify the best business expert in our database for the project.
The project briefing is a working document throughout the initial phase of staffing and gets
updated frequently by the sales team until appropriate candidates are found for the project.
The data team recently introduced a seniority filter into the expert requirements section of the
project briefing. Based on several criteria like years of work experience, job type and job level
each consultant gets a seniority level assigned ranging from junior to senior.
Job type and level are assessed by our consultants relation department during onboarding of
our consultants into our pool. For example, we have different finance experts (level 1 to 3) and
consultants (level 1 to 3). A consultant level 1 with 8 years of work experience is set to ‘junior’, a
finance expert level 3 with 20 years of experience is set to ‘senior’.
In our app you can now search for e.g. junior, mid-level or senior consultants based on what
kind of experience level you need for a project.
The filter was a long requested feature by our sales team and we believe that it is a powerful
one that will improve our matching. Since it is a newly released feature, at this stage we are
concerned with achieving a high level of end-user engagement.
Please describe to us the alternative techniques that you would suggest for tracking the usage
of the filter with an aim to provide the product team useful data for improving the engagement.
What parameters would you be tracking, how would you set the tracking up, how do you get
data into our data warehouse and what kind of dashboards would you be building for the
stakeholders to monitor?
